        <h2>LAB DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <h3>Satisfied Requirements</h3>
        <p>Create a blank (white) canvas at least 500 x 500 in dimension.</p>
        <p>Recognize left and right mouse clicks. Echo the mouse positions for each mouse click (use console.log).</p>
        <p>Maintain a list of points representing positions of mouse clicks (both left and right).</p>
        <p>Draw lines between pairs of points.</p>
        <p>Draw rubberband line between the last point and the current mouse position.</p>
        <p>Print out sequence of mouse click positions when a polyline is complete (when right-click of mouse is detected). Note that it's possile to draw multiple polylines. For this assignment, only one poyline is required. </p>
        <h3>Unexecuted Requirements</h3>
        <p>After the right mouse button is clicked, it is still possible to move around a line from the last pressed point, but the user cannot make any further permanent points/lines.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>USER GUIDE:</h2>
        <p>Move mouse around canvas and left-click to draw a point. Move the mouse again to decide where to place a rubberband line on the next left mouse click. In the console, view the coordinates of each mouse press. On a right click, the polyline will be complete and the user can view a list of all coordinates pressed in the console.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>EXTRA FEATURES:</h2>
        <p>I attempted to include the code from the text book to change the color of the clicked points depending on the quadrant, but there were errors with gl.uniform4f(...) so I was unable to successfully add this feature.</p>
