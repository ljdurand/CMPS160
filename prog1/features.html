        <h2>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <h3>Satisfied Requirements</h3>
        <p>Create a blank (white) canvas at least 500 x 500 in dimension.</p>
        <p>Recognize left and right mouse clicks. Terminates polyline on right mouse click.</p>
        <p>Draw rubberband line between the last point and the current mouse position.</p>
        <p>Rotates 12 coordinates around point and prints out array to console.</p>
        <p>Translates 12 coordinates from unit cylinder to the left mouse points and prints array to console.</p>
        <p>Creates an index array and prints it to the console.</p>
        <p>Creates a vertex array with both indices and coordinates for each index to connect and prints array to console.</p>
        <p>Stores and extracts GC</p>
        <h3>Unexecuted Requirements</h3>
        <p>drawArrays() and drawElements() do not function, so even though the coordinates rotated around the vertex and the indices are calculated, the lines do not draw.</p>
        <p>Does not display file on canvas after extracting.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>USER GUIDE:</h2>
        <p>Move mouse around canvas and left-click to create a rubberband line. Move the mouse again to decide where to place a rubberband line on the next left mouse click. Coordinates are calculated to generate a cylinder between the last and most recent mouse clicks. The polyline is completed when the user right clicks. The user can also save a file, choose the file, and extract the file. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>EXTRA FEATURES:</h2>
