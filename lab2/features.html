        <h2>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <h3>Satisfied Requirements</h3>
        <p>Create a blank (white) canvas at least 500 x 500 in dimension.</p>
        <p>Recognize left and right mouse clicks. Terminates polyline on right mouse click.</p>
        <p>Draw rubberband line between the last point and the current mouse position.</p>
        <p>Rotates 12 coordinates around point and prints out array to console.</p>
        <p>Translates 12 coordinates from unit cylinder to the left mouse points and prints array to console.</p>
        <p>Creates an index array and prints it to the console.</p>
        <p>Creates a vertex array with both indices and coordinates for each index to connect and prints array to console.</p>
        <p>Stores GC</p>
        <p>Calculates surface normals and colors of polygons</p>
        <p>Displays surface normals on toggle</p>
        <p>Displays shaded cylinders with some kind of lighting</p>
        <h3>Unexecuted Requirements</h3>
        <p>Does not connect edges of cylinders</p>
        <p>Does not extract files</p>
        <p>Does not calculate light correctly and displays normals in center of canvas</p>
        <br>
        <h2>USER GUIDE:</h2>
        <p>Move mouse around canvas and left-click to create a rubberband line. Move the mouse again to decide where to place a rubberband line on the next left mouse click. Coordinates are calculated to generate a cylinder between the last and most recent mouse clicks. The polyline is completed when the user right clicks and 3D cylinders are formed with light. The user can also save a file, choose the file, and extract the file. If the user enables normals, the normal vectors will be displayed. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>EXTRA FEATURES:</h2>
        <p>None.</p>
